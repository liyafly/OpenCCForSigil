# Release and artifact validation

Release packaging is split into two steps:

1. build and verify exact official OpenCC wheel payloads;
2. validate and package the shared Python plugin and manifest.

`tools/vendor_opencc.py` performs step 1. `tools/build_plugin.py` performs step
2 and invokes manifest/payload verification before packaging. It validates
`plugin.xml`, the code version, and the one-top-level-directory ZIP shape. No
unverified wheel payload is synthesized or copied.

The release job must also run `tools/differential_test.py` against an
independent official CLI from the same pinned OpenCC release. Any Python
Binding/CLI difference is blocking; golden candidates are review-only and are
never used to auto-accept changed conversion output.
